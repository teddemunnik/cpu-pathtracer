# CPU Pathtracer
This is the source code to the CPU pathtracer I created as part of my education. The project uses monte carlo integration to converge to a clear image over de duration over multiple (loads of) frames. During this project my main goal was to achieve as good performance as I could in the given timeframe. This means that this project is definately not feature-rich both because more adding features would decrease performance and more time was spent improving performance than adding features.

Having the chance to do this project again I would spend more time profiling code and making sure all required features are implemented before optimising.
